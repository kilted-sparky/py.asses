===== Diary/Notes HELP=====

This function is a free text function. When you enter it will ak whats happening today,
you can then enter notes, whats on your mind, anything you like really.

It is a one line entry system so you will be able to enter as much as you like but it will be in one line.
if you hit ENTER it will ask if there is anything else you would like to enter:

yes - will allow you to enter more test

no - will quit out to the main menu

open - will open the diary/notes. However will only show the entry from the previous 
       use of the function. If you wish to view what was just entered you will need
       to quit out and return.

This is a prototype, going forward updates to this functiuon will allow multiple line etries
and to show the most recent entries.
